# Personality-Prediction-System-via-CV-Analysis
The provided code performs a factor analysis on a dataset using Python's pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries. Initially, it loads a dataset from a CSV file called "responses.csv" and selects a specific subset of columns. Missing values in the dataset are then removed. The categorical data is encoded using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn. The code employs the factor_analyzer library to conduct factor analysis, initially fitting a model to explore the eigenvalues, which helps determine the number of factors. A scree plot is created to visualize eigenvalues. The code then fits a factor analysis model with five factors using varimax rotation. Loadings are extracted to identify the top variables contributing to each factor, and the results are displayed in a table. Finally, the code pivots the table to show the top variables for each factor.
